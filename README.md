# InteractiveRatingComponent
 A small project that handles user interactions and updating the DOM with JavaScript from Frontend Mentor

This is my solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Thanks to my recent practice with JavaScript event listeners; the scripting portion of the assignment took very little time. My CSS skills are a bit rusty; however, and I spent far too long trying to get the circular elements the correct shape.

- 2023, January 23
    - Completed the project after about 4.5 hours.

### Continued development

Since I spent way too long with CSS, I'm going to continue with the Frontend Mentor challenges. This will allow me to become better with JavaScript while maintaining my understanding of CSS. 

### Useful resources

- [RGB to HSL](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/color/rgb-to-hsl.html) - I found this super helpful for determining equivalents when trying to add a few extra colors 
- [W3Schools CSS Reference Sheet](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/) - Very handy resource! I'm going to continue with this one
